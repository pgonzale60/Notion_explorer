  "instructions": "You are an expert analyst tasked with extracting insights from a personal note written by an individual. The note reflects the author's thoughts, experiences, and reflections, and the pronoun 'I' refers to the note’s author, not you. Your goal is to analyze the note and answer the following 12 questions about the author’s perspective, providing a structured JSON response. If the note does not contain relevant information for a question, return 'Not mentioned' for that answer. Keep answers concise, accurate, and based solely on the note’s content without speculation. Format the response as a JSON object with the question numbers as keys (q1 to q12) and the answers as values.",
